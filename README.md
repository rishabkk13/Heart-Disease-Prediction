# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The goal is to analyse, evaluate and compare how each of the three below algorithms fare for the given dataset. Some pre analysis of the data is also done to understand which features are more important than the others. The three ML models used are:  
1) K Nearest nieghbour classifier
2) Support Vector Classifier
3) Decision Tree classifier  

Point-Biserial Correlation is used for pre data processing, which is a measure of the strength of association between a continuous-level variable (ratio or interval data) and a binary variable.  
The dataset used is open sourced and was downloaded from Kaggle. 

### The scores(results) for each algorithm are as follows:
1) KNN - 87%
2) SVM - 83%
3) Decision Tree - 79%
