# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The goal is to analyse, evaluate and compare how each of the three below algorithms fare for the given dataset. The ML models used are:  
1) K Nearest nieghbour classifier
2) Support Vector Classifier
3) Decision Tree classifier  

Point-Biserial Correlation is used for pre data processing, which is a measure of the strength of association between a continuous-level variable (ratio or interval data) and a binary variable. This is done to understand which features are more important than the others.    
The dataset used is open sourced and was downloaded from Kaggle. 

### The scores(results) for each algorithm are as follows:
1) KNN - 87%
2) SVM - 83%
3) Decision Tree - 79%
